Holy smokes it's August 1st already. The summer is half over?!

I'm trying to install Nextcloud on my Orangepi and basically just want to rip my hair out over it. I know enough to know something isn't working, but not enough to know just... what that is.

I'm doing this Blaugust thing, or at least, I'm going to try. This is the first! Kind of phoning it in (I started this post last night when it was late, but I'm technically completing it on the 2nd - don't tell the blogcops).

Let's fuckin go?
