#### Hi, I'm Vae - mid thirties, she/her, big fan of the smallweb.

>"The Old Norse term véttr/vættr and its English cognate wight are descended from Proto-Germanic wihtiz (thing, creature), from Proto-Indo-European >wekti- ("object, thing"). Vættr and wight normally refer to supernatural 'being', especially landvættr (land spirit), but can refer to any creature."

I chose **Vaettr** as my handle because Wight is family name belonging to relatives of mine who are long passed but remain near and dear to my heart, and to whom I owe so much. The spooky connotation is a happy coincidence, as I'm ~~a bit~~ entirely a spooky girl at heart.


I live in Canada, and spend my time learning to code and makin' stuff - oil painting, drawing, knitting, spinning, producing music, sewing and any other crafty pursuits I can get my hands on. I also recently learned to solder to repair my midi keyboard's USB-B port, and now I have the electronics repair bug. 


I've loved computers and the idea of the internet since I was a little kid, biking the 5km every day all summer to use the computers at the public library, learning HTML from Neopets to decorate my shop. I think I made my first website, on geocities, at about 12 years old, as a gift to my first boyfriend for Valentine's day, complete with drippy blood horizontal rule decoration. Peak romance.
