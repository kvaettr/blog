Some ideas!

* I want to get Arch Linux working on WSL2 with KDE set up properly so I can play with ricing and making it look all cute 

* I have a Proxmox server on a NUC set up with UbuntuLTS and I want to do more self-hosting - every time I spin something up to host for myself, it never lasts because problems crop up and I end up nuking the installs and starting over. And over and over again.

* I want to build my family tree locally, so I can learn more about where I come from.

* I have a HUGE collection of CDs now that I want to finish ripping to FLAC and start hosting, myself. Also scrobbling and tagging (with Picard). I also want to build a music library of sorts for this blog.

* ... along with lots more slash pages, a ridiculous screenshot gallery and thrift hall of fame page for the best finds I come across.

* Acquired a broken Olympus OM-D E-M5 camera and have taken it (mostly) apart in an effort to fix a stuck shutter. Probably gonna make a post about it because I have no idea what I'm doing and learning as I go. I really want to make it work again so I can use it to explore photography again.

* One day I want to learn pottery and to make a whole set of dishes and a tea pot and tea mugs

* I want to make most of my clothes to match my _dream aesthetic_ - folk-horror meets dark academia, lots of natural fibres, texture, dark muted colours and with rough cut stones and wrought iron incorporated into jewelry. Like if Miss Honey (from the movie Matilda) had a slightly more goth vibe in that adorable little cottage of hers. I can spin yarn and knit, I can sew and quilt, and a couple years ago I sewed a dress-form with my measurements so I should be able to pick up pattern drafting in order to design some things, once I get my feet under me in the new house.

* This adorable little white hatchback I bought recently has a little rust around the butt - I want to learn the most basic body-work skills to be able to fix that up and mitigate future damage. I'm hell-bent on learning car stuff to fill the shameful holes in my mechanical knowledge and so I can keep this car running FOR. EV. ER. because used car shopping is a literal nightmare when you have no idea what you're doing.

* I have an OrangePi 4LTS single board computer that I have installed YunoHost onto, and while that's all well and good, I don't know enough about port-forwarding to do so safely and without potentially causing security issues so I'm holding off until I learn more - but when I DO, oh it's over for you, ~~bitches~~ Google.
