title: A Small Web July

Hey! It's July! I've just redone the colours of the blog, and I was procrastinating on what to start blogging again about. While browsing Mastodon, along comes a [post by Annie](https://anniemueller.com/posts/small-web-july), joining [Small Cypress in Small Web July](https://smallcypress.bearblog.dev/a-small-web-july/) - I figured hey, I can ease in with that! This is my plan, distilled:

* Given that I already only use Mastodon for social media, I think I'm going to focus on properly building my RSS feed reader with people's blogs to follow. I've made a few attempts over the last year, with Omnivore (RIP), Vivaldi and with self-hosting my own service. Haven't nailed down exactly where I'm going to read my subscriptions (I would still be using Vivaldi if I hadn't just switched to [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net) ) and my self-hosting solutions are volatile at best as I'm still learning, what with all the container nuking and OS installing I've been doing these days. 


* I want to continue journaling, privately, on pen and paper in a little notebook I picked up a couple days ago. I gotta build that creative momentum again, and not every day is a blog post - some days it's stream-of-consciousness brain-dumping in hot pink ballpoint, but either way it makes me take notice, and taking notice fuels creativity, be it writing, art, or whatever. 

  Journaling is so instrumental in giving me clarity and focus every day that I need to feel like a fully realized, active participant in my life. It's important for me to be consciously thinking through my days and choosing how to spend my time. I always need to be more present, and defining for myself my thoughts and feelings about things going on in my life helps centre me and choose a path forward. I used to keep notebooks on notebooks all through childhood (though I have kept none of them) and {% footnoteref "1" "day one and i'm absolutely fucking roasting myself lmfao" %} through hard times and as a way of willfully blinding myself to my reality I fell out of the habit{% endfootnoteref %}.

* In that same vein, in an effort to more consciously consume media, I was thinking maybe I would post a weekly media roundup of videos, songs, movies, articles, books, whatever I've got my hands on, in particular highlighting what I've been enjoying. In my many forays into blogging during the early 2000s I really loved sharing poems I found, or pieces of music that struck me that week, and I think that's a format I want to resurrect for myself. 

* I want to be blogging in general, building the numerous neat little pages that I've been knocking about in my head for some weeks, while also refreshing my knowledge of HTML and CSS and how 11ty works. More sharing, something something rewards of making friends v. [the mortifying ordeal of being known](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-mortifying-ordeal-of-being-known) , etc.

The Internet is Other People, and part of that is this blog, me trying to show up in my own way.
