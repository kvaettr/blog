Having a relaxing morning, playing with Vscodium, trying to revive this little blog of mine, and remember/relearn how eleventy works.

I have been learning *so much* over the last few months and am so excited to start sharing the things I'm hacking on. I have my own little server set up with proxmox to play with ubuntu, I have a separate little kali lab isolated on its own network and I just installed arch on WSL2 on my main PC to see how that works.

It feels really good to learn, solve problems and make things work.

On that note, let's see if this posts.
