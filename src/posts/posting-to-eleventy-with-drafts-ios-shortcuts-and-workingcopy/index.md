I'm trying this new way to post courtesy of <a href="https://florian.ec/blog/post-to-eleventy-ios-drafts-shortcuts-working-copy" rel="noopener noreferrer">florian.ec</a> - using Drafts to craft a post and Shortcuts to move it into Working Copy.

Let's test the image upload with a picture from last Thursday's sunset.
