More of a test post than anything, I wanted to double check that everything is working on my end - I had to review how to set up my VSCode and how to set up my Github so I could clone and push changes to my blog's repo, which is watched by Netlify and deployed from there. Lots of relearning to do - I haven't touched any of the web dev stuff I was teaching myself since August of last year - just prior to my move! I took some notes back then on how to do some things, but reviewing them made the holes in my memory all the more clear to me. I'm going to have to dip back into Obsidian and write myself some kind of guide for getting back up and running again should I need to (knock on wood it won't come to that again!). 

I got a new M4Pro Macbook Pro as a belated birthday gift and I'm starting to get back into coding along with music production in Logic Pro X now that I have such an incredibly capable machine. I really do feel like this little laptop could last me the rest of my life, I can't foresee needing anything else, especially given that I do any/all gaming on PC. I've already stickerbombed it to shit, too, with Mimikyu, Nosferatu, the Pale Man (eyesballshandsguy from Pan's Labyrinth), BMO from Adventure Time, and the Silence of the Lambs iconic moth-mouth image. Still trying to figure out my workflows and how I want to organize things, what apps I want to install, but that's all part of the fun, isn't it? Yay new toy!

Gotta relearn what I was doing with Eleventy and what I was trying to build with music/reading/watching collections in the backend here and get back on track! More than ever I feel like this practice of learning, sharing and putting my little site into the world is a tiny act of resistance to kind of internet that infringes upon rights of people to their own voice, devices and data. 

More coherent posting later, thanks for reading <3
