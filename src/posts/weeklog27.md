title: Weeklog Number 27-2025

I'm starting these weeklogs with the number of the week, so number 27 it is!

Watched an anime with my daughter called "[Look Back](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1244492)". It was so emotional, my god it broke my heart! It's about two schoolgirls learning to become mangaka and their journeys together and in parallel. There's also some interesting (read also: gutting) time skip segments that disrupts the mundanity and realism of it a little. Great movie, and at 58 minutes runtime, it's an easy watch. Definitely recommended!

I have been using [Feeed
](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feeeed-rss-reader-and-more/id1600187490) on my iPhone to read RSS feeds but I'm keeping an eye out for a more multi-platform solution - might go back to self-hosting something on my little NUC I have running Proxmox.

I want to get some proper collections set up in 11ty, and have one for Mastodon posts, getting things set up to do [the good ol' POSSE thing. Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). [Robb from the omg.lol community](https://social.lol/@robb@social.lol) built [Echofeed](https://echofeed.app/) and it's gonna be perfect for this!

I plan on keeping notes to have more to share next week, and I'll be posting some recent sketchbook photos too. 

Today was a beautiful, beautiful day spent at the riverside.
