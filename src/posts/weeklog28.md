It's been a busy week for me, I restarted a medication whose side effects absolutely thrashed me for a couple days and so this weeklog, only my second!- is already days late. No matter - onward!

I've been keeping up with journaling pretty well this week, it's been a great way to stay in touch with the underlying thoughts that exist and aren't really given time to breathe and expand a little the way they can when I put them down on paper.

My FreshRSS install is up and running beautifully - I installed it as a container on my Proxmox server running downstairs and I love it! I have a list of feeds from this post on mastodon to start with along with the few web directories I can't wait to comb through - that was one of my favourite things to do back in they day.

## Something I watched:

One ridiculous piece of media (meta-media? media about media?) I saw and enjoyed was an analysis of the [Shark Boy and Lava Girl movie](https://archive.org/details/the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl). This is a movie that came out in the vacuum of time where I was not the least bit aware of children's entertainment - in the span of time between me being and child and having children of my own. It was released in 2005, I was graduating high school. My priorites consisted of spending mid-day floating on my back in a lake instead of going to English class, movies of this genre weren't remotely on my radar. That being said, after my children were born, we watched it a number of times together when they were small and I had some memory of it. 

I gotta say, the way this guy breaks it down and reveals the surprisingly complicated, all-connecting primordial plot beneath it all is endlessly entertaining. If you're the kind of person who enjoys watching someone explain something ridiculous and fun with a special-interest level of depth, and rabid fanaticism (like I absolutely do) then I recommend it.

I expect the format of this weekly post to evolve over time, grown and shrink as it does, but I like the idea of making an effort to post something weekly, like a checkpoint. Thanks for joining me!
