An update! Almost timely, even!

## Something I'm watching:
I've been really enjoying watching this one show "[Common Side Effects](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/228878-common-side-effects)" with my partner and our friend - one of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time (though that's not saying much, I've been partaking in a steady diet of youtube true crime and video essays for what feels like forever). It's about this guy who discovers a very potent medicinal mushroom and tries to regrow it with the help of his friend. It's pretty fantastically animated, too. Adult Swim knocked it out of the park on that one. 

## What I'm playing:
I'm playing a lot of Pokemon Go again, I always seem to come back to it in the summer. Just a sweet and fun way to pass the time. Between Pokemon Go, the Pokemon TCG Pocket game and the Leaf Green save I've been plugging away at on my PC, in the GBA emulator, I'm up to my eyeballs in Pokemon. I've also picked up my Cyberpunk 2077 save again, trying to get my bearings in that world. 

I've been daydreaming about painting again, it's been months since I began a memorial portrait and I want to finally finish that up and move on to some bigger oil pieces. 

Been thinking a lot about journaling lately, about how there are so many things I want to make notes about, keep track of, etc, and how that would normally necessitate, to me, a bunch of separate books - but I always seem to have half finished notebooks full of scribbling loosely tied together by subject matter. 

Would it really be so bad if I kept one exhaustive journal/notebook/planner/commonplace book for all the notes about life and what I'm learning? I mean, once the book is full I can rifle through it and save important information in Obisidian for easier search and retrieval later, and then put the original Everything Book in storage. That would make one book to carry, one book to worry about, one book to bring them all and in the darkness bind them etc.

I need to be less precious about stationery, especially nice notebooks and just fucking USE them.
