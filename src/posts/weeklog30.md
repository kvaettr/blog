Been a busy, emotional rollercoaster of a week. 

Started reading The Excellent Mind by Nathan L King, about intellectual virtues and “good thinking”. I’ve been preoccupied a little lately with trying to organize my thoughts, organize my notes about things I’m learning or wanting to learn more about. Youtube videos have consisted of a bunch of similar content in that same vein. I’m making a list of things I want to research, and I’m hoping to build some kind of body of resources to support it. 

In particular, for instance, I’m curious about the intersection (if there is one) between mindfulness and mental health, and the ritual practices found in witchcraft, meditation, visualization and the like. I want to learn more about whether the physical interaction with the world around us and the deliberate practices found in witchcraft has an effect on the psyche and one’s wellbeing, or brain function, or whatever. Not necessarily building a case for witchcraft, but investigating whether ritualistic, symbolic spiritual practices can have a marked impact on one’s mental health or acuity at all, and if so how can an average non-woo person approach ritual practices with that goal in mind. 

Not exactly the most clear of descriptions, but there it is. 


Anyway, posting this from the Working Copy app on my phone, so here’s hoping I can push this update from mobile while I’m out of the house.

Renewed my YMCA membership this week as well, so I’ll be looking into some strength training classes alongside picking up running again (an ill-advised choice given my hypermobility but hoping the doctor-ordered strength training alongside slow runs mitigates any injury). 

I can’t believe it’s August already!
