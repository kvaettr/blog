Today was a lesson in backups - I locked my keys in my bedroom. Along with my medication, my cannabis and my lockpicks.
I've gotta make a spare key so this never happens again, that's all I gotta say.

It's been a rough few days, but I'm looking forward to going swimming with the kids tomorrow. 

Been browsing this [webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) and finding all kinds of creative sites I'm excited to sift through. That was one of my favourite things to do growing up, when ye old yahoo site directories were a thing.

Wanted to get some kind of post out this evening, so sleepy.
