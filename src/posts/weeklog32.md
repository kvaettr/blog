Clinging tightly to the following in this rapidly waning summer:

>"My dear,
>>>In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.
>>>>In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.
>>>>>In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.
>>>>>>I realized, through it all, that…
>>>>>>>In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

>And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back."

>>-Albert Camus
